<h1>my first webpage</h1>
<p >welcome to my amazon webpage</p>
    Building my first webpage has been an exciting, yet daunting experience.
    I wanted to create something that was functional, visually appealing, and easy to navigate. 
    After browsing through some of the world's best websites, I decided to take inspiration from the one that's always stood out to me. Amazon's homepage.
    While I couldn't replicate all of it's features, I thought, why not take a shot at coding a page with a similar structure and design.
